/*
* 1. The messages here are similar to those used in the DecaRanging ARM application (shipped with EVK1000 kit). They comply with the IEEE
 *    802.15.4 standard MAC data frame encoding and they are following the ISO/IEC:24730-62:2013 standard. The messages used are:
 *     - a poll message sent by the initiator to trigger the ranging exchange.
 *     - a response message sent by the responder allowing the initiator to go on with the process
 *     - a final message sent by the initiator to complete the exchange and provide all information needed by the responder to compute the
 *       time-of-flight (distance) estimate.
 *    The first 10 bytes of those frame are common and are composed of the following fields:
 *     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8841 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit addressing).
 *     - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
 *     - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA).
 *     - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 3 below.
 *     - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 3 below.
 *     - byte 9: function code (specific values to indicate which message it is in the ranging process).
 *    The remaining bytes are specific to each message as follows:
 *    Poll message:
 *     - no more data
 *    Response message:
 *     - byte 10: activity code (0x02 to tell the initiator to go on with the ranging exchange).
 *     - byte 11/12: activity parameter, not used here for activity code 0x02.
 *    Final message:
 *     - byte 10 -> 13: poll message transmission timestamp.
 *     - byte 14 -> 17: response message reception timestamp.
 *     - byte 18 -> 21: final message transmission timestamp.
 *    All messages end with a 2-byte checksum automatically set by DW1000.
 * 2. The preamble timeout allows the receiver to stop listening in situations where preamble is not starting (which might be because the responder is
 *    out of range or did not receive the message to respond to). This saves the power waste of listening for a message that is not coming. We
 *    recommend a minimum preamble timeout of 5 PACs for short range applications and a larger value (e.g. in the range of 50% to 80% of the preamble
 *    length) for more challenging longer range, NLOS or noisy environments.
* 3. Delays between frames have been chosen here to ensure proper synchronisation of transmission and reception of the frames between the initiator
 *    and the responder and to ensure a correct accuracy of the computed distance. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM Source Code Guide for more
 *    details about the timings involved in the ranging process.
 * 4. 5. This timeout is for complete reception of a frame, i.e. timeout duration must take into account the length of the expected frame. Here the value
 *    is arbitrary but chosen large enough to make sure that there is enough time to receive the complete response frame sent by the responder at the
 *    110k data rate used (around 3 ms).
